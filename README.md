# Capstone-Project
## Penetration Test for Artemis

### Overview
Time estimate: 18 hours

### Learning Objectives:

* Apply knowledge, processes, and techniques acquired in this course to the
planning, scoping, and execution of a penetration test.

* Explain the various types of tools and techniques used to gather information and
identify vulnerabilities.

* Develop the communication skills necessary to deliver a written report to senior
management.

A fictitious client has hired your consulting firm to perform an
external penetration test. You must create the scope and approach based on the
information provided by the client. However, to prepare yourself and your team for this
engagement, you must conduct a structured walkthrough of the pen test, which will help 
ensure that all team members are adequately prepared to perform the required
activities.

The structured walkthrough is in five phases.

### Assumptions
* You have already been given the target IP ranges.
* You have already determined the timing and duration of the penetration test.
* You have already identied the key contacts of the client who will be notified of the testing.
